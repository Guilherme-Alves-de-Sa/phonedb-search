# phonedb-search
Search for devices of a given json file in phonedb.net, returns how many of those devices have a resolution lower than 640x1136

This was made in a day and only works for phonedb.net

Commented in Portuguese

Json File is unidimensional every device has atleast one of the these two attributes: "device_model_name" or "device_hardware_model"
There's an example in devices.json
